# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
[Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Case Study](urhttps://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analyticsl)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! This is one of the case studies in the Google Data Analytics Course. In this case study, I work for a fictional company Cyclistic. I have decided to use R for this analysis.

## Scenario

Cyclistic is a bike-share company. The marketing director believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. I want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. This is one of the questions in the **Ask** phase assigned to me.
